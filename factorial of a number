#Python Program to Find the Factorial of a Number

#define factorial here
factorial=1

#take a input from a user
a=int(input("enter the number \n "))

#use for loop to do to check a factorial
for i in range(1,a+1):
    factorial=factorial*i
    print(factorial)
    #using the if for 0th factorial
if a==0:
    print(f"factorial of {a} is 1")
